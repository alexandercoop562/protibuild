# Introduction

Welcome to **Protibuild** - an open-source protein simulator and builder that brings molecular biology to life through interactive 3D visualization.

## What is Protibuild?

Protibuild is a desktop application designed for researchers, students, and enthusiasts to:

- **Visualize proteins** in realistic 3D environments
- **Explore amino acid structures** with accurate ball-and-stick models
- **Interact with molecules** by picking up and moving objects in 3D space
- **Switch between project templates** for different viewing modes

## Key Features

### Molecular Visualization
- **Ball-and-stick model** for accurate molecular representation
- **CPK coloring** - standard chemical colors for each element
  - Hydrogen (H): White
  - Carbon (C): Gray
  - Nitrogen (N): Blue
  - Oxygen (O): Red
  - Sulfur (S): Yellow

### Supported Molecules
- **All 20 standard amino acids** with accurate atomic positions and bond connectivity
- **Dev Cube** - a simple rotating cube for development testing

### Interactive Controls
- First-person camera navigation
- Pick up and move objects in 3D space
- Adjust object distance with scroll wheel

## Technology

Protibuild is built with:
- [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) 0.18 - A refreshingly simple data-driven game engine
- Rust - For performance and safety

## Getting Started

1. **Launch the application** - You'll start in the "Dev Cube" project
2. **Open the File menu** - Click "File" in the top-left corner
3. **Select a project** - Choose "Amino Acids" to see all 20 standard amino acids
4. **Navigate with WASD** - Press **C** to capture your cursor, then use movement keys
5. **Interact with objects** - Hover over molecules and click to grab them
