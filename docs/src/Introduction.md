# Introduction

Welcome to **Protibuild** - an open-source protein simulator and builder that brings molecular biology to life through interactive 3D visualization.

## What is Protibuild?

Protibuild is a powerful application designed for researchers, students, and enthusiasts to:

- **Simulate proteins** in realistic environments
- **Build new protein structures** with intuitive tools
- **Visualize molecular interactions** in real-time 3D

## Why Protibuild?

Understanding protein structure and behavior is fundamental to modern biology, medicine, and drug discovery. Protibuild makes these complex concepts accessible through:

- Interactive 3D visualization powered by the [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) game engine
- Real-time simulation capabilities
- An intuitive interface for building and manipulating molecular structures
